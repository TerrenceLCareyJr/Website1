Best use on Desktops and Laptops. It's doable for mobiles, but the "flip card" doesn't return to initial state after you hover over it. It just stays on the backside of it. I'm sure that can be fixed and I'll look into it. 

(6/16/2021) I made it responsive enough that it's better now than yesterday. The flipping of the card is still the same. I'm not sure on how to make it flip like it does for laptops and desktops. I will find that solution soon.
